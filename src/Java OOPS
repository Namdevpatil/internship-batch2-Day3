OOPS: object oriented programming system
====

Why OOPS?
bottom up approach

Why not Procedural Programming?

=> functions: data 
=> top to down

problems: 
1. it is slow as compare OOPS
2. it do not  have clear structure of the program.
3. the code it not reusable, modifiable, maintainable and not able to do debugging 
4. it takes more time to develop the programs
